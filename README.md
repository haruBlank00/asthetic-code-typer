# Asthetic Code Typer

I want to make a code typer if that makes any sense lol

anyway, I want to past code and I want to format the code and create a typing like effect.

## Plans

Libraries

- ShadCN for UI
- Prism.js or prism-react-renderer for syntac highlighter
- typeitjs typeit-react for typer effect

How many pages do I even need?
A single page?
With 2 colums page?
One for setting and pasting code and anther for the effect?

After install necessary libraries and making some component for themes and stuffs
Let's make a FormBuilder to render and manage form :)
We need few (many?) input fields to change our typeit options and enter code as text as well :)

Zod for schema validation
react-hook-form for form management
shad-cn for ui
FormBuilder for form map
